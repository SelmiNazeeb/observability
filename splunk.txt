  	  SPLUNK
	----------
- Splunk instance
- App home
	> This is the main starting page for a specific Splunk App
	> App in Splunk is like a Set of features built to solve a specific problem
	> Apps are defined by a user with an administrator role
	> EG: there is an app for security monitoring and another for IT operations. When you open an app, you land on its "App Home" page.

- Roles : Roles are a way to manage what users can and cannot do in Splunk
  > Administrator Role
	- Can do everything
	- create knowledge objects for users ()
	- Full control over the Splunk instance, including managing all users, roles, system settings, and installing apps
  > Power Role
	- can create and share all knowledge objects and perform real time searches ()
	- Can create and share reports, dashboards, and alerts
	- Can "tag" events to make searching easier for others
  > User Role
	- see only own knowledge objects and those shared with them ()
	- Can search and run their own reports and dashboards. But can't share to others
	- view data they are given access to

knowledge objects
-------------------
- Saved Searches, Reports & Dashboards, Tags, look up tables
- lookup table : your Splunk data don't have a a column u want . u created another file with 2 columns in which one is in Splunk data and other is new. then 
                 said Splunk to compare both and ask for some search u want and got the information u want
- tags :  you can use a single tag to find all related events instead of multiple terms. eg; u want 'failed' and 'denied' logs, u can create a tags named 	  'authentication failure' for failed and denied. then whenever u want u can just use that tag.
- reports and dashboard : u search some data using a complex command and save that as a report/dashboard. then if u want that again u can just click on that 			  report or if any friend want to see, u can share the report to them.

- Table views
- transforming commands : commands that create statistics and visualization 
- By default a search job will remain active for 10 minutes
- shared search job will remain active for 7 days
- export formats : xml, raw data, Jason, csv
- search modes : Fast mode, smart mode, Verbose mode
	> Fast
	  - field discovery disabled
   	  - designed for performance
	  - returns your search results as quickly as possible
	  - It only returns the essential, default fields and fields you explicitly search for
	> verbose
	  - designed for completeness
	  - It will return as much information as possible from your data, but it will take longer to run.
	  - best for Troubleshooting, debugging
	> smart
	  - automatically decides whether to act like Fast or Verbose mode depends on your search
	  - If your search includes a command that creates a report (like stats or chart), it behaves like Fast Mode to give you the results quickly.
	  - If you're just looking for events without a reporting command, it acts like Verbose Mode to show you all the available details.

searching terms
---------------
- wild card
	Examples:-
	- error*: This will find any words that start with "error," such as error, errors, error_code, and erroneous.
	- *fail*: This will find any words that contain "fail," such as failed, failure, login_fail, and fatal_fail.
	- host-web-??: While not a wildcard, you can use ? in some systems to represent a single character, as in this example where you could search for 	  host-web-01 or host-web-02
- Boolean operation - NOT, OR, AND . parenthesis () can use to control the evaluation
- escape character in search (\)

search language of Splunk - build from 5 components
----------------------------------------------------
search terms : foundation of search queries. starting point of every search. (login)
commands : tells what we want to do with search results (creating charts, computing statistics, formatting)
	   You use a pipe (|) to start a command (login| stats)
functions : explain how we want to chart, compute and evaluate results (login| stats count)
arguments : variables we want to apply to the function
clause : how we want result grouped or defined

- All are not case sensitive. But command values are case sensitives

- Data interpretation
- Data classification
- Data enrichment
- Data normalization
- Data models

- classic dashboard: older and are best for quickly creating a simple, functional view of your data.
- Dashboard Studio: new, modern tool that gives you much more control and flexibility to create a professional and visually appealing dashboard.

- layout in dashboard studio : grid, absolute
- choose Grid for simplicity and automatic alignment, and choose Absolute for total creative control and custom design elements
