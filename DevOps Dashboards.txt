DevOps Dashboards
-------------------
1. DORA Metrics Dashboard
	Track the Four Key Performance Metrics for software delivery

- Deployment Frequency – How often code is deployed to production. Monitoring deployments per day/week shows agility.
						 The more often you deploy, the faster your users get new features or bug fixes.
- Lead Time for Changes – Time from code commit to production deployment; shorter lead times suggest efficient pipelines.
						  time period b/w receiving order and delivering to the customer
- Change Failure Rate (CFR) – Percentage of deployments causing failures (e.g., rollbacks, incidents).
							 It tells us how often a new code change/ causes problems after it’s deployed.
- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) – Time taken to restore service after a failure.

2. Pipeline Health & Efficiency Dashboard
	Focus on internal pipeline metrics:

- CI Runs per Day – Number of builds or tests executed daily.
- CI Success Rate – Percent of builds/tests that pass on the first try.
- PR Size – Average lines changed per pull request—smaller PRs usually mean faster reviews and lower risk.

3. System Stability & Infrastructure Dashboard
	Monitor system health and performance:

- Availability / Uptime – Percentage of time services are operational.
- Resource Utilization – CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network usage.
- Change Failure Rate – To reflect service reliability metrics in duo with DORA.

4. Issue/Error Tracking Dashboard
	Surface error trends and issue resolution rates:

- Number of Errors – Track frequent error codes (e.g., 404, 500).
- Issue Volume & Types – Count of tickets/issues over time, broken down by severity/type.

5. Cost & Efficiency Dashboard
	Bring FinOps insights into the DevOps workflow:

- Cloud Cost Metrics – Cost per deployment, service, team, or transaction.
- Infrastructure Cost per Transaction – Helps manage and optimize resource spend.

Security Dashboards
----------------------
1. Vulnerability & Risk Dashboard
	Monitor security vulnerabilities and technical debt:

- Vulnerability Open Rate (VOR) – How many vulnerabilities are detected per release.
- Security Technical Debt (STD) – Count of unresolved security issues.
- Mean Vulnerability Age (MVA) – Time since discovery to resolution.
- Software Security Coverage (SSC) – Percentage of systems covered by security scans.

2. Detection & Incident Response Dashboard
	Track detection and response metrics:

- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) – How quickly your team notices a security incident.
- Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) – Time taken to remediate security incidents.

3. Compliance & Logging Dashboard
	Ensure regulatory and audit-readiness:

- Log Coverage – Are all critical systems being logged and monitored?
- Compliance Status – Visibility into GDPR, ISO 27001, SOC 2 adherence.
- Alert Volumes – Counts of alerts, incidents, and false positives.
